           This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate classification model from a heterogeneous classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Our goal is to 
           achieve greater incremental improvement in accuracy, compared to using a single type of classification model throughout the process. The strategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets. We further 
           consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non-adaptive active learning and traditional machine learning approaches. Our results show 
           that... We conclude that...

        <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>

        <p class="ex1">
            Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence
            of learning epochs.

        <h4 class="ex1">Patient Diagnosis</h4>
        <p class="ex1">
          Currently, the most accurate method to diagnose type 2 diabetes is to do a blood test. However, researchers from Klick Applied Sciences have developed a tool that may become the next technological 
          advanced test to use at home to diagnose type 2 diabetes. There have been many studies that show that there is an influence of type 2 diabetes on the voice. A systematic review in 2019 concluded there 
          was a “higher prevalence (12.5%) of voice problems among individuals with diabetes […] as compared to the general population”.  (Ravi et al, 2019). This includes hoarseness, increased strained voice and 
          excessive throat clearing.

        <h4 class="ex1">Medical Diagnostic Imaging</h4>
        <p class="ex1">
            Artificial intelligence has taken many roles in medicine. Currently, the most common role for AI is medical imaging analysis. This is where artificial intelligence tools are being used to analyse 
            and identify abnormalities in x-rays, CT scans and other scans that might be missed by professional healthcare staff. It is very likely that AI will become an integral part of the healthcare system. 
            Research has shown that AI systems are as effective as human radiologists at finding abnormalities and detecting signs of cancer as well as other conditions (Lang et al, 2023).
        </p>

          <p class="ex1">
            A growing area of AI research is on developing AI algorithms for predicting the risk of disease in patients, as opposed to simply detecting patterns in images (Sharma et al, 2020).
          </p>

          
          <h4 class="ex1">Robotic Surgery</h4>
          <p class="ex1">
            The American company ‘Intuitive Surgical’ created a surgical system called ‘Da Vinci’ in honour of Leonardo DaVinci who studied and sketched human anatomy. He created a humanoid robot that was able 
            to move around and was operated by pulleys. The ‘Da Vinci’ system can perform complex, minimally invasive surgery via a console that is controlled by surgeon (Hamet et al, 2017). As of December 2022, 
            over 7500 da Vinci systems were in operation in hospitals worldwide, with more than 11 million robotic surgeries carried out with Da Vinci robots (Guthart, 2023). 
          </p>

        <p class="ex1">
          Robotic surgery has both positives and negatives for patients and the surgeon. Robotic surgery offers patients a shorter hospital stay, less risk of infection and faster recovery (The Leeds Teaching Hospitals, 2023). 
          However, there are also concerns about the reliability of robotic surgery. In a study by the Severance Hospital, Yonsei University Health System in Seoul, Korea, 10267 Da Vinci robotic surgeries were carried out in 
          7 departments by 47 surgeons. This study allowed an extensive analysis based on multiple surgeries across multiple departments. Among the 10267 procedures performed at Severance Hospital, system malfunctions were 
          reported in 185 cases (1.8%) as seen in Table 1 (Koh et al, 2018) which shows the failures and malfunctions using the system. 32 cases had a mechanical failure/malfunction error, 23 had a system error, while 130 had 
          an instrument error. Most of the malfunctions were related to an instrument error, but this was easily solved by simply replacing the malfunctioning instrument. Mortality was linked to 12 Da Vinci surgery cases (0.12%) 
          (Koh et al, 2018).

        <p class="ex1">
          Ultimately, the study concluded that robotic surgery was a safe alternative to traditional surgery. This study could be limited as it only assessed the safety of robotic surgeries during a specific period 
          of time at a single hospital which would not be reflective of the practice of robotic surgery as a whole. Given that the mortality rates from using the Da Vinci system are only recorded at this institution, 
          it does not represent global trends. However, this study can give a well-informed insight of what global trends may look like.
